## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis, pulling data from several weather-recording stations in Hawaii, is supposed to inform the opening of a surf shop. Before this business venture is opened, the potential owners are attempting to gather insights on weather trends to ensure that there will be demand for their product. 

## Results 
Main differences in extracted weather measurements between June and December:
1. The December temperatures are, on average, 3°F colder than those in June. This means that surfers may be less inclined during this month to purchase items sold at the surf shop.
2. While the maximum recorded temperatures in June and December are within 2°F of one another, the minimum temperature in December is 8°F colder than that in June. This shows that there may be unpredictably low temperatures in December that negatively impact sales.
3. The standard deviation of temperatures in December is roughy 3.75 while the standard deviation in June is about 3.26, meaning that the temperatures in December may be much more variable and harder to predict. This may make success of the business somewhat volatile.   

## Summary
In summary, the weather in this particular location in December compared to in June appears colder, more volatile, and not very promising for the business of a potential surf shop. A couple queries could potentially inform the understanding of year-round weather conditions.
